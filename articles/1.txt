Corporate America helped put Joe Biden in the White House.

Democrats received record “dark money” donations during the 2020 election cycle.

From Open Secrets.org:

The 2020 election saw more than $1 billion in “dark money” spending at the federal level, a massive sum driven by an explosion of secret donations boosting Democrats in a historically expensive cycle.

Despite this, many in the GOP continue to protect corporations instead of the American people.

GOP Rep Chip Roy sent out a tweetstorm calling out these Conservatives.

Roy pointed out that these corporations are “using massive market power combined with government-corporate cronyism to impact negatively – in real time – the lives, liberty, & ability to pursue happiness of the American people.”


Here is the rest of his Twitter thread:

“Instead, corporate America is – across multiple industries – using massive market power combined with government-corporate cronyism to impact negatively – in real time – the lives, liberty, & ability to pursue happiness of the American people…It is hardly deniable that #BigTech & #BigMedia are using their power along with govt regulatory protection to impact what we read, see, & hear in a way designed to affect policy. It’s true re: #COVID, race/CRT/BLM, gender/trans (e.g. Disney), CO2/Energy & more…It is hardly deniable that #BigHealthcare is using its massive power to enrich itself thru corporate crony policies. Obamacare “coverage” mandates, COVID mandates, tax policies biased to corporations – all reducing access to doctors & limiting… #HealthcareFreedom…It is hardly deniable that #BigEducation (a mix of University & K-12 monopoly, union influence, corporate cronyism) limits options for parents and students – keeping them trapped without choice to accept the “agenda” however radical & hostile to their values it is…It is hardly deniable that #BigEnergy & #BigGreen (w/ help of #BigTech & #BigEducation) are making large profits off of subsidies at the expense of small/mid-size energy companies and the well-being / flourishing of Americans (& empowerment of Russia & China)…the GOP should promote policies that are radically pro-small business, pro-competition, anti-ESG, pro-#EducationChoice, pro-#HealthcareFreedom & end preferences/subsidies in energy… while ending deficit spending. Laissez-fair in economics, but not blind to the abuse…by #BigCorp of market power combined with government funding & tax/regulatory policies to undermine fundamental freedoms & core values while rolling over the ability of small businesses & STATE GOVERNMENTS to enable us to live how we prefer in a federalist system.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is showing conservatives how to fight back against corporate America.

Rather than allowing Disney to dictate how Florida is run, they are eliminating their special privileges. Both the Florida House and Senate have passed bills taking on Disney.

From Fox News:

The Florida House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday that would dissolve Walt Disney World’s special governing power in the state.

The move could have huge tax implications for Disney, whose series of theme parks have transformed Orlando into one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, and serves to further sour the relationship between the Republican-led government and a major political player in the state.

The bill will now head to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis who has been involved in a war of words with the company after it publicly opposed a bill he signed which prohibits classroom instruction on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” with children in third grade or younger “or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”
