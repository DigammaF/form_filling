The left is trying to cancel famous author J.K Rowling.

The cancellation attempts began back in 2020 when Rowling said, “I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth.”

Fox News reported:

“Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling appears to have successfully used the legal baton to force a critic who called her a “Nazi” to apologize.

J.K. Rowling has faced fierce backlash from former fans because of her views and statements about transgender individuals and biological sex. Rowling first made headlines in June 2020 after sharing a series of tweets on her thoughts regarding the concept of sex.

“If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased,” she tweeted at the time. “I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth.”

Self-described JJ Welles took to Twitter to attack J.K. Rowling.

Welles said that Rowling “is a nazi or at least has views that align with them.”

Rowling responded by asking if Welles would be advised to defend that in court.
