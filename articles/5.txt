Leaked video surfaced showing Disney employees discussing injecting “queerness” into Disney programming.

One part of the video shows the executive producer Latoya Raveneau claiming that Disney is welcoming of this.

From The Daily Caller:

The Walt Disney Company has not made a public statement or responded to requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation regarding leaked videos which purport to show employees discussing the company’s strategy to inject “queerness” into programming.

The videos were released Tuesday by Manhattan Institute senior fellow and activist Christopher Rufo, who said the clips were from a Disney company meeting about the Florida Parental Rights in Education bill.

People in the videos, who Rufo identified as Disney corporate president Karey Burke, executive producer Latoya Raveneau and production coordinator Allen March, reportedly discussed their efforts to promote gay and transgender content, according to the videos.

The woman Rufo identified as Raveneau reportedly said Disney’s leadership was very welcoming of her “not-at-all-secret gay agenda,” according to one of the videos.

Here is the video:

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also called out Disney for their opposition to a bill protecting children from being sexualized in schools.
