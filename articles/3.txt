Donald Trump is ready for the 2024 GOP primary.

He just humiliated Nikki Haley after she announced her run for President despite claiming prior she wasn’t going to run if Trump did.

Trump mocked Haley saying, “The greatest thing Nikki Haley did for our Country, and the Great State of South Carolina, was accepting the position of United Nations Ambassador so that the incredible then Lieutenant Governor, Henry McMaster, could be Governor of South Carolina.”

Truth Social:

Nikki Haley had a hard time making the decision to run for President because she very publicly stated that she “would never run against the President. He did a GREAT JOB, and was the best President in my lifetime.” I told Nikki to follow her heart, not her ambition or belief. Who knows, stranger things have happened. She’s polling at 1%, not a bad start!!!

The greatest thing Nikki Haley did for our Country, and the Great State of South Carolina, was accepting the position of United Nations Ambassador so that the incredible then Lieutenant Governor, Henry McMaster, could be Governor of South Carolina, where he has done an absolutely fantastic job. That was a big reason why I appointed Nikki to the position—It was a favor to the people I love in South Carolina!

Trump also shared reasons not to vote for Nikki Haley.

They include, Hillary Clinton being her inspiration for running, supporting RINO Paul Ryan’s entitlement plan, supporting sending more fighter planes to Ukraine, being weak on immigration, and not supporting a transgender bathroom bill to protect children.
